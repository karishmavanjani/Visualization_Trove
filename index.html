    <h1>Nvidia keeps AI at the center of things, slaps off gaming </h1>
    <p class="subtitle"> Graphic card company restructures its business to look more futuristic <p class="subtitle">
            <!--    <br> -->
            <p class="copy">
                Nvidia, known for gaming graphics cards, is redirecting its path to bet on artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
                The chipmaker has been aggressively shedding its gaming skin to transform itself into a full-fledged GPU company with AI at its heart.
            </p>
            <p class="copy">
                “Having the world's best GPU, of course, just the starting point,” the usually high energy CEO Jensen Huang, said matter-of-factly on a recent earnings call. </p>
            <p class="copy">Graphics Processing Units or GPUs is how Nvidia initially captured local desktop gamers. Later, the GPUs that enhanced responsive controls in video games powered data centers of numerous tech giants including Microsoft and Google. Taking data center business up a notch, Nvidia went on to integrate the same GPUs with CUDA, a software platform that doubled the efficiency of computers. Higher the efficiency, lesser the time it took for retail consumers or developers to execute their general mathematical calculations and complex lines of code which form the basis of all AI applications. Watching the market lap up CUDA, Nvidia went knee-deep into AI with robot simulators, autonomous vehicle technology and more. The result-Nvidia’s data center revenue has grown nine-folds from $340 million in 2015 to $3 billion last year, whereas gaming revenue only doubled. Today, Huang calls Nvidia a software brand over a graphics supplier in every conversation.

            <p class="copy">“Nvidia is going in a different route,” said Romeo Alvarez, analyst at William O’ Neil. “I think they are taking a complete view of both hardware and software but what really differentiates them is the software.” </p>
            <p class="copy">Huang’s future vision to capitalize on AI, not only excites the investors but also sees backing by retail customers. The thrill of it has moved the company’s stock to $206.04, an increase of over 50% this year.

            <p id="chartContainer" style="height: 300px; width: 60%; padding-left: 200px;"></p>
            <p class="copy">A year ago, Niyant Dave, masters student at Northeastern’s data analytics program was in the market for a laptop.
            </p>
            <p class="copy">For machine learning, a desktop PC is preferred. But, “I thought if I have a good laptop I would still be able to work with big data in less time,” said Dave.</p>
            <p class="copy">He bought a Dell G7 which runs on Nvidia flagship GPU, the GeForce 1060 GTX.“Then I came to know my professors had three strong computers assembled from Nvidia.”
            </p>
            <p class="copy"> Nvidia GPUs reign supreme in the AI training market, but only in recent years have they made inroads into this domain. This transformation into an AI-first company resurrected the company out of the crypto rut that crashed it’s Q4 2018 revenue figures. </p>
            <p class="copy"> Automotive was one of the segments that witnessed more growth after the crypto bust than it did before. Nvidia reported $537 million in sales for automotive this year, an addition of $60 million compared to the $478 million figure last year. </p>
            <p class="copy"> The business segment picked up steam this year partly due to the partnerships announced with both Volvo and Toyota Research Institute in the first half of 2019. </p>
            <p class="copy">Pick up in gaming wasn’t as strong. The sector rebound to $4 billion at the end of October and remained 24% below the $5 billion mark it hit before the crypto bust last year.
            </p>
            <p class="copy">Autonomous, a part of their auto segment will see growth, according to Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities. </p>
            <h2>Total revenue in three quarters of 2019 </h2>
            <p class="copy"><img src="images/Revenue-2019 and Revenue-2018-01.png" style="height: 320px; width: 600px; width: 100%;">
                <p class="copy">This segue from the hearts of gamers into the hands of developers required Nvidia to pullback on its gaming business. The step back comes at a time when gaming is seeing new competitors and has started to evolve. </p>
                <p class="copy">The traditional video-game industry, much like TV and movies, has shifted to streaming in recent years.
                </p>
                <p class="copy"> To cater to this need, Nvidia launched GeForce Now, a cloud-gaming platform in the beta version two years back. But even as competition intensified in 2019 and a dizzying number of companies, including Google, jumped into the fray with gaming services, GeForce Now remains in the beta mode. In fact, it started to remove games off its platform, a move that has agitated some members of the gaming community.
                </p>
                <p class="copy">Adding to that, gaming consoles like Nintendo Switch that are powered by Nvidia’s Tegra chips didn’t update their technology in 2019. </p>
                <p class="copy"> CFO Colette Kress in response to Nvidia’s dwindling cloud gaming service said in an email that the segment has seen progress through partnerships with new service providers.</p>
                <p class="copy"> For now, though, Nvidia can afford to diversify into new sectors and keep gaming on the down-low.
                </p>
                <p class="copy">Hardcore gamers prefer the local gaming experience run by GPUs and streaming still needs to tackle infrastructure challenges faced especially in the Asia Pacific - a market that contributes more than three times Nvidia’s revenue in the US -before it sees widespread adoption. </p>
                <div id="stage"></div>
                <p class="copy">“As it stands, cloud gaming is not an acceptable alternative to dedicated hardware for most of these consumers [traditional gamers],” said Randy Nelson, analyst at Sensor Tower, a mobile analytics group. “The high bandwidth and network hardware requirements of these services present issues even in areas with excellent infrastructure.”</p>
                <h2>Revenue from individual regions in 2019 (Value in billions)</h2>
                <p class='e'> All boxes together represent total of $7.8 billion </p>
                <br>
                <div class="chart"> </div>
                <p class="copy"> Expanding its AI business, Nvidia said it sees future growth thanks to EGX edge, software for enterprises to perform the second-step in machine learning known as data inferencing "at the edge." This means for companies such as Walmart, BMW, and other adopters, analyses happen by devices that are located where the data is being collected and not in far away locations.
                </p>
                <p class="copy"> One of Nvidia’s key competitors, AMD, has not seen the growth Nvidia has on the stock market. But it’s not that big on AI either. </p>
                <p class="copy"> Recently the company reported earnings of $1.45 per share for the third quarter, a decline of 0.26% compared with $1.97 a year ago. AMD reported an increase of 0.02% for the same period but Nvidia's EPS is over 13 times that of AMD.
                </p>
                <h2>Net income growth</h2>
                <p class="copy"><img src="images/Net-income-chart.svg" style="height: 320px; width: 600px; width: 100%;"> </p>
                <p class="copy"> Sealing its AI strategy, Nvidia announced the acquisition of data-connectivity company Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) earlier this year. The deal was expected to close by the end of 2019 but Chinese regulators have yet to give a nod of approval.
                </p>
                <p class="copy"> Last year, a similar deal between Qualcomm, a telecommunications equipment firm and NXP Semiconductors was called off due to China’s inaction amid the trade war spat.
                </p>
                <p class="copy"> But, regardless of the $7 billion Mellanox deal going through or not, Nvidia’s long-term view won’t see an impact. Continuous pumping of AI expertise into various sectors; be it healthcare or retail, has kept investors at the edge of their seats, always waiting to see which hand or in this case sector Nvidia deals with next. Till the time industry-wide chants of ‘AI being the future’ continue, the strategy will pay off.
